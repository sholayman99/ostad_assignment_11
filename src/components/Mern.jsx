        The MERN stack is a colloquial name given the full stack JavaScript
        development framework consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and
        Node.js. As a full stack framework, the MERN stack covers front end
        operations with React, server infrastructure with Express.js and
        Node.js, and database operations with MongoDB. MERN is quickly becoming
        one of the most commonly used full stack development frameworks owing to
        its versatility and the integration between the stacks various
        elements. Learning to use the MERN stack will let users build complex
        websites and applications. Each aspect of the Stack serves a different
        function. Still, they are all built off the JavaScript programming
        language, meaning skilled JavaScript users can easily pick up each
        aspect of the stack. React is used to build client-side assets and
        component bundles of code that can be replicated and repurposed as
        developers see fit. This framework is built to improve workflow and
        create more dynamic single-page applications. Node.js and Express.js
        provide the infrastructure for programs to query and access server-side
        requests, allowing those applications to run JavaScript code outside a
        web browser. MongoDB is used for sorting, analyzing, and querying
        databases as part of a web application. Taken together, MERN stack
        training will let users design all aspects of complex web design
        projects. Read more about what the MERN stack is and why you should
        learn it. What Can You Do with the MERN Stack? Using the MERN stack,
        skilled programmers can develop and maintain all aspects of a web
        application. Using these four JavaScript frameworks, you can build the
        front end, back end, and database infrastructure for complex webpages,
        including the increasingly in-demand single-page applications and
        internet-enabled devices we use daily. The more complex a web
        application is, the more complex its programming will need to be, and
        learning the MERN stack offers students an accessible way to learn full
        stack web development skills. Learning the MERN stack will also let
        users take advantage of the functionalities of each framework for their
        non-full stack web development projects.
